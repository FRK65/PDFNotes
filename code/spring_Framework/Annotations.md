# 1. Spring annotation 

# 1. @RestController 
It is used to define a controller where every method is capable of handling 
HTTP requests, and the response is automatically converted to JSON or XML 
(depending on the configuration). 
It is a specialized version of the **@Controller** annotation, 
which is used for building RESTful APIs.

It combines the behavior of @Controller and @ResponseBody
It Automatically serializes objects to JSON or XML

**@RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody**

When you annotate a class with @RestController, then @RestController add the 
@ResponseBody to each handler method of that class implicitly.
And Spring Boot treats all the handler methods of that class as being responsible for generating the
response body for RESTful requests. 
It eliminates the need to annotate individual methods with @ResponseBody because @RestController implicitly adds it
to all the methods.

# 2. @Controller
It is one of the core annotations in Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
It is used to define a Spring MVC controller that processes incoming HTTP 
requests and returns a response, often in the form of a view 
(such as a JSP or Thymeleaf template) or other resources. 

The @Controller annotation marks the class as a Spring MVC controller.
It require @ResponseBody for  serializes objects to JSON or XML
~~~
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/json")
    @ResponseBody
    public MyObject getJsonResponse() {
        return new MyObject("John", 30); // Automatically serialized to JSON
    }
}
~~~

# 3. @RequestBody 
- The @RequestBody annotation tells Spring to deserialize the incoming 
JSON into a User object.
- It tells Spring to bind the incoming HTTP request body to a Java object 
(e.g., JSON or XML).
- Ex. Accepting JSON data from a client and converting it into a Java object
(e.g., POST request)

# 4. @ResponseBody 
- The @ResponseBody annotation tells Spring to serialize the returned 
User object into JSON and send it back in the response body.
- it Tells Spring to write the return value of a method directly to 
the response body (e.g., JSON or XML)
- Returning a Java object as JSON to the client (e.g., GET request)

# 5. @Autowired 
- @Autowired is used for dependency injection
- it is used to inject dependencies automatically into Spring beans
- It can be used with constructor injection, field injection, or setter injection.
- Spring can inject dependencies via constructor, field, or setter injection.
- When you annotate a field, constructor, or setter method with @Autowired, 
Spring will look for a matching bean in the Spring context 
(i.e., the Spring ApplicationContext). 
If it finds a bean that matches, it will inject it automatically.

# 6. @Resource

- @Resource is a standard Java annotation for dependency injection, 
defined in the **javax.annotation package**
- @Resource injects a bean by name by default. This means that it looks for a bean in the Spring context that matches the name of the field or method parameter being annotated
- It allows Spring to inject beans into a class either by name (default) or type (fallback).
- It is similar to @Autowired but prioritizes name-based injection, making it more useful when you need to specify a particular bean by its name.

| **Feature**                  | **@Autowired**                                                              | **@Resource**                                                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Injection Criteria**        | Injects by type (unless `@Qualifier` is used)                                | Injects by name first, then by type if needed                               |
| **Name Matching**             | No default name matching, relies on type                                    | Defaults to matching bean by name (name attribute)                          |
| **Bean Lookup**               | Can inject beans of the same type (via `@Qualifier`)                         | No need for `@Qualifier`, relies on name first                              |
| **Flexibility**               | More flexible when dealing with multiple beans of the same type             | Less flexible for type-based injection                                      |

# 7. @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping

In Spring, the @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, etc., 
are specialized versions of the @RequestMapping annotation, 
designed to handle HTTP requests for the corresponding HTTP methods 
(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) in a cleaner, more semantic way.

# 8. HTTP Method Mappings in Spring

In Spring, annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, and `@PatchMapping` are used to map HTTP requests to controller methods. These annotations are more specific and readable alternatives to `@RequestMapping` for handling HTTP methods.

| Annotation         | HTTP Method | Use Case                          | Example Endpoint         | Example Action                                |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **`@GetMapping`**   | GET         | Retrieve data (Read)              | `/users`                 | Fetch all users                              |
| **`@PostMapping`**  | POST        | Create a new resource             | `/users`                 | Create a new user                            |
| **`@PutMapping`**   | PUT         | Update an existing resource       | `/users/{id}`            | Update user with ID                          |
| **`@DeleteMapping`**| DELETE      | Delete a resource                 | `/users/{id}`            | Delete user with ID                          |
| **`@PatchMapping`** | PATCH       | Partially update a resource      | `/users/{id}`            | Partially update user with ID                |

### Example Usage in a Spring Controller

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    // GET request to retrieve all users
    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        return userService.getAllUsers();
    }

    // POST request to create a new user
    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        return userService.createUser(user);
    }

    // PUT request to update a user
    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
        return userService.updateUser(id, user);
    }

    // DELETE request to remove a user
    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        userService.deleteUser(id);
    }
}
```
# 9. @Component 

In Spring Framework, @Component is an annotation that marks a Java class as a Spring bean. 
When a class is annotated with @Component, Spring will automatically detect it during component 
scanning and register it as a bean in the Spring ApplicationContext. 
This means that Spring will manage the lifecycle of that class, and you can inject it into 
other components (e.g., other beans or controllers) using dependency injection.

# 10. @Service
In Spring, the @Service annotation is a specialization of the @Component annotation, 
which is used to mark a class as a service-layer bean. 
It is part of Spring's stereotype annotations, and it indicates 
that the class contains business logic or services. While @Component
is a generic annotation for any Spring-managed bean, @Service is more 
semantically meaningful, suggesting that the class is intended to perform service-related tasks.

# 11. @Repository
@Repository is also a specialization of @Component and represents a repository
or data access component. It is commonly used for classes that interact with
the database or any other data storage mechanism. Repositories typically provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for accessing and
managing persistent data

# 12. @Transactional 
The @Transactional annotation in Spring Boot is used to define the transactional
behavior of a method or a class. Means it can used with method or class.
Transactions annotation ensure that a set of operations are
treated as a single unit of work, providing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency,
Isolation, Durability) properties.

By annotating a method or class with @Transactional , Spring Boot automatically
manages the transactional behavior, handling transaction demarcation,
propagation, and rollback based on the configured settings.

The @Transactional annotation can be placed at the method level, where it
defines that the method should be executed within a transactional context. It can
also be placed at the class level, where all public methods of that class become
transactional.

The purpose of the @Transactional annotation is to simplify transaction
management by providing a declarative way to define the transactional
boundaries. It allows developers to focus on the business logic without worrying
about the low-level transaction management details.

Great, you've written a very clear and detailed explanation of many core Spring annotations. Now, let's **explain** the remaining three annotations — `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@EnableCaching`, and `@EnableTransactionManagement` — **in the same structured and concise way** as your other entries.

---

### 13. `@EnableAutoConfiguration`

**Purpose**:
Automatically configures Spring application context based on the dependencies present in the classpath.

**Key Points**:

* Part of Spring Boot's core functionality.
* Used to reduce boilerplate configuration.
* Enables beans automatically based on JAR dependencies.
* Often used along with `@SpringBootApplication`.

**Behind the scenes**:

* It looks for `META-INF/spring.factories` to determine which `@Configuration` classes to import.
* For example, if `spring-boot-starter-web` is on the classpath, it configures Tomcat, Jackson, DispatcherServlet, etc.

**Example**:

```java
@SpringBootApplication // includes @EnableAutoConfiguration
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

---

### 13. `@EnableCaching`

**Purpose**:
Enables Spring’s annotation-driven cache management capability.

**Key Points**:

* Allows the use of caching annotations like `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, `@CacheEvict`.
* Improves performance by storing method return values in cache.
* Must be used in conjunction with a cache provider (like EhCache, Redis, Caffeine, etc.).

**How it works**:

* Spring creates proxies for your beans and intercepts method calls to handle caching logic.

**Example**:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
public class MyApp { }

@Service
public class UserService {
    
    @Cacheable("users")
    public User findById(String id) {
        return database.findUserById(id); // This is cached
    }
}
```

---

### 14. `@EnableTransactionManagement`

**Purpose**:
Enables Spring’s annotation-driven transaction management.

**Key Points**:

* Activates support for the `@Transactional` annotation.
* Automatically creates proxies around beans/methods annotated with `@Transactional`.
* Allows declarative transaction management (no need to manage transactions manually).

**Modes**:

* **Proxy-based (default)**: Only works with public methods.
* **AspectJ-based**: Can work with private/protected methods too.

**Example**:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class AppConfig {
    // Define DataSource, TransactionManager, etc.
}
```

**Usage**:

```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    @Transactional
    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        inventory.decreaseStock(order.getProductId());
        payment.process(order);
        orderRepository.save(order);
    }
}
```
