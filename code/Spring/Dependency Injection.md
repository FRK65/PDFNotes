Let's continue with the next **Core Spring** topic:

# üå± **Dependency Injection (DI)** ‚Äî one of the **core pillars** of the Spring Framework.

---

## ‚úÖ **1. What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to **externalize the creation and management of dependencies** from a class.
Instead of creating dependent objects manually inside a class, **Spring injects them automatically** at runtime.

> üí° ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt create the object ‚Äî just ask for it!‚Äù

## ‚úÖ **2. Why Use Dependency Injection?**

| Benefit                   | Explanation                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üîÑ **Loose Coupling**     | Components don't need to know how to create or manage dependencies |
| üß™ **Easier Testing**     | You can mock dependencies easily                                   |
| üîÅ **Better Reusability** | Components can be reused with different implementations            |
| üì¶ **Managed Lifecycle**  | Spring manages lifecycle (singleton, prototype, etc.)              |
| ‚ôªÔ∏è **Cleaner Code**       | No need for `new` keyword or manual wiring                         |

## ‚úÖ **3. Types of Dependency Injection in Spring**

| Type                         | Description                                    | Example                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| üîß **Constructor Injection** | Dependencies are passed via the constructor    | Recommended                  |
| üì¨ **Setter Injection**      | Dependencies are set via public setter methods | Optional                     |
| üß© **Field Injection**       | Dependencies injected directly into fields     | Not preferred (hard to test) |

---

## ‚úÖ **4. Real-Life Analogy of DI**

Imagine you're a **coffee shop owner**:

* You need a `CoffeeMachine`.
* Instead of buying one yourself, your assistant (Spring) provides a `CoffeeMachine` based on your need.

You just say: ‚ÄúI need coffee capability‚Äù ‚Äî and the right machine is provided.

---

## ‚úÖ **5. Constructor Injection Example (Recommended)**

```java
@Component
public class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

@Component
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ **6. Setter Injection Example**

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ **7. Field Injection (Not Recommended)**

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Field injection is concise, but not good for **unit testing** and **readability**.

---

## ‚úÖ **8. XML-Based vs Annotation-Based Configuration**

**Legacy XML:**

```xml
<bean id="car" class="com.example.Car">
    <property name="engine" ref="engine"/>
</bean>
```

**Modern Annotation-Based:**

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;
}
```

## ‚úÖ **9. Common Annotations in Spring DI**

| Annotation       | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `@Component`     | Marks a class as a Spring bean               |
| `@Autowired`     | Instructs Spring to inject a dependency      |
| `@Service`       | Specialized `@Component` for service classes |
| `@Repository`    | Specialized `@Component` for DAO classes     |
| `@Controller`    | Specialized `@Component` for MVC controllers |
| `@Configuration` | Declares a configuration class               |
| `@Bean`          | Declares a bean manually (Java config)       |

## ‚úÖ **10. Best Practices for DI in Spring**

| Practice                               | Reason                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Prefer Constructor Injection         | Immutability and easier testing         |
| ‚ùå Avoid Field Injection                | Harder to test and maintain             |
| ‚úÖ Use `@Component` & `@Autowired`      | Simpler, cleaner configuration          |
| ‚úÖ Inject Interfaces                    | Allows easy swapping of implementations |
| ‚úÖ Use `@Qualifier` when multiple beans | Resolves ambiguity                      |
