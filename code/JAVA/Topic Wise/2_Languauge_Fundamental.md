### **Q.1 What do you mean by Identifiers?**

**Answer**:
**Identifiers** are the names given to various elements in a program, such as variables, methods, classes, and objects. In Java, identifiers are used to identify variables, methods, classes, etc.

* **Key Concept**: Identifiers must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z), underscore (\_), or a dollar sign (\$), and subsequent characters can also include digits (0-9).

**Real-life Example**:
In the class `Person`, `name` and `age` are identifiers representing properties of the person.

```java
class Person {
    String name;  // identifier
    int age;      // identifier
}
```

### **Q.2 Explain Rules of Java Identifiers?**

**Answer**:
The rules for valid Java identifiers are as follows:

* Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z), underscore (\_), or a dollar sign (\$).
* Can only contain letters, digits (0-9), underscores (\_), or dollar signs (\$).
* Cannot use Java keywords (e.g., `class`, `if`, `public`).
* Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning `Variable` and `variable` are different.
* Should avoid using special characters like `@`, `#`, etc.

**Real-life Example**:
`int studentAge;` is a valid identifier, but `int 2ndStudent;` is invalid because it starts with a number.

### **Q.3 Difference between float and double data type?**

**Answer**:
**float** and **double** are both used to represent decimal numbers, but they differ in precision and size:

* **`float`**: 32-bit precision, can store up to 7 decimal digits.
* **`double`**: 64-bit precision, can store up to 15 decimal digits.

**Real-life Example**:
Use `float` for less precision (e.g., approximate calculations), and `double` for higher precision (e.g., scientific calculations).

```java
float f = 3.14f;   // float
double d = 3.14159265359;  // double
```

### **Q.4 Why does the `char` data type take 2 bytes of memory in Java?**

**Answer**:
The **`char`** data type in Java takes 2 bytes (16 bits) of memory because Java uses **Unicode** to represent characters, which allows it to support characters from many different languages (including non-Latin alphabets).

* **Unicode Representation**: Unicode can represent over 65,000 characters, and each character needs 2 bytes of memory.

**Real-life Example**:
In Java, a **`char`** like `'A'` is stored as `65` in Unicode, which requires 2 bytes of memory.

```java
char letter = 'A';  // 2 bytes, Unicode encoding
```

### **Q.5 What are the advantages and disadvantages of arrays?**

**Answer**:

* **Advantages**:

  * **Fixed Size**: Efficient storage and access of multiple elements of the same type.
  * **Easy to Use**: Arrays make it easier to store and manipulate multiple values.

* **Disadvantages**:

  * **Fixed Size**: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed (i.e., it’s not dynamic).
  * **Memory Waste**: If an array is too large for your needs, memory is wasted. If it's too small, it might not store all the values.

**Real-life Example**:
A **student grades array** can store grades for multiple students, but the size cannot be altered during runtime.

```java
int[] grades = new int[5];  // Fixed size of 5
```

### **Q.7 What are the differences between instance and static variables?**

**Answer**:

| Aspect       | **Instance Variables**                              | **Static Variables**                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**    | Specific to an instance of the class.               | Shared across all instances of the class.            |
| **Memory**   | Each object has its own copy of instance variables. | There is only one copy for all objects of the class. |
| **Lifetime** | Exists as long as the object exists.                | Exists as long as the class is loaded into memory.   |
| **Access**   | Accessed via object reference.                      | Accessed via class name or object reference.         |

**Real-life Example**:

* An instance variable like `age` would vary between different **Person** objects.
* A static variable like `companyName` is shared by all **Employee** objects.

### **Q.8 What do you mean by the var-arg method?**

**Answer**:
The **var-arg method** in Java allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a method. You can pass any number of arguments of the same type, and they are treated as an array inside the method.

* **Syntax**: The var-arg parameter is specified using `...` after the type.

**Real-life Example**:
You could create a method to sum any number of integers.

```java
public int sum(int... numbers) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int num : numbers) {
        total += num;
    }
    return total;
}
```

### **Q.9 What are the advantages of the var-arg method?**

**Answer**:

* **Flexibility**: Allows passing a variable number of arguments, making methods more flexible.
* **Cleaner Code**: Avoids the need for method overloading or creating arrays manually.
* **Readability**: The method signature is simpler and clearer when you don’t need to define multiple overloads.

**Real-life Example**:
In a **Logger** class, you can log multiple messages without overloading the method.

```java
public void logMessages(String... messages) {
    for (String message : messages) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```

### **Q.10 What changes can we perform on `main()`?**

**Answer**:
The `main()` method can be modified in the following ways:

* **Method Signature**: You can add `public`, `static`, and `void`, but the signature `public static void main(String[] args)` must be maintained for the program entry point.
* **Access Modifier**: You can use any access modifier like `public` or `protected`.
* **Parameters**: The parameter `String[] args` can be changed to other types, but it’s standard to use `String[]`.

**Real-life Example**:
You could add logging to print out the arguments in the main method:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Arguments: ");
    for (String arg : args) {
        System.out.println(arg);
    }
}
```

### **Q.12 What do you mean by command line arguments?**

**Answer**:
**Command line arguments** are the arguments passed to the program when it is run from the command line. These arguments are accessible via the `args` parameter in the `main()` method.

* **Purpose**: To provide input values to the program at runtime without hardcoding them.

**Real-life Example**:
Running the Java program via the command line:

```bash
java MyProgram arg1 arg2 arg3
```

The program would access `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` through the `args[]` array.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    for (String arg : args) {
        System.out.println(arg);
    }
}
```
